    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
        The Facebook Platform offers an ecosystem that already gave birth to many companies. It also presents a strong value for the social network, which monetizes the platform through sharing revenue models, but also because the platform generated several services that were then incorporated in the Facebook user experience.

        However, the overall developer experience using the Facebook APIs is rather deplorable: design patterns are not standard, tutorials and documentation are not state of the art. Neither has the company shown stainless neutrality in the past, cutting off access to companies infringing their policies, and especially the non-core functionality replication clause, that remains a subjective matter.
