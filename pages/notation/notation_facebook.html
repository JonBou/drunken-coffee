                            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                            <p>
                                The Facebook Platform offers an ecosystem that already gave birth to many companies. It also presents a strong value for the social network, which monetizes the platform through sharing revenue models, but also because the platform generated several services that were then incorporated in the Facebook user experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, the overall developer experience using the Facebook APIs is rather deplorable: design patterns are not standard, tutorials and documentation are not state of the art. Neither has the company shown stainless neutrality in the past, cutting off access to companies infringing their policies, and especially the non-core functionality replication clause, that remains a subjective matter.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Company Trust</h3>
                            <p>
                                It is water under the bridge since Facebook’s controversial IPO during the spring of 2012, when after ten days Facebook’s shares were traded half their 38$ initial price. Facebook repeatedly beat analysts forecasts, with mobile advertising revenues soaring between first and third quarters 2013. As a result, shares reached 50$ in late September. Facebook is more established than ever.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Facebook Platform was launched in 2007, and hence an early player in the public API world. It was conceived as a framework for software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook features. Facebook’s API and SDK ecosystem is huge, and the structuration of the App center in May 2012 aims at helping best gaming and social apps to promote themselves. The ecosystem already gave rise to quoted companies such as Zynga.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But developers seems to quit the Facebook platform because of:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>New virality constraints and rules</li>
                                    <li>The APIs change too often</li>
                                    <li>Competition is hard</li>
                                    <li>Ad rates for traffic acquisition are higher than is the past</li>
                                    <li>Less travtion from VCs on Facebook apps than for Mobile apps</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Team Involvement</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Facebook Platform feeds are very active through Facebook and Twitter. The developer portal also efforts to reach the community of developers through its blog, events listing and roadmap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nonetheless, we have been informed by an undisclosed source that the Facebook API evangelist team quit in October 2013 and the position is not expected to be filled again.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Policy</h3>
                            <p>
                                Facebook has a strong record of externalizing innovation through its APIs. About twenty startups building services on top of Facebook were acquired, then shut down, while their innovations were incorporated in Facebook and their team members joined Facebook. It can sound unhappy, but this is a fair strategy to manage innovation through a public API.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, Facebook also has a record of cutting off API access for infringing policies, particularly replicating core functionality, which Facebook used to justify revoking access to messaging apps, and Reciprocity, meaning that social services using Facebook API have to allow user to share experiences directly back on Facebook.
                            </p>
                            <h3>API Design and Documentation</h3>
                            <p>
                                Facebook has an engineering culture driven by “Stay focused, keep shipping and break things”  and the partners of Facebook have to follow these changes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Part of this retooling means that there’s a maintenance tax on whatever app has been created on the platform, since you have to pull your prized engineers off their projects to do constant maintenance and reintegration into the new viral channels. That’s just to keep up. It also means that what works today may not work tomorrow. If you are making important decisions on staffing, business models, financing, then a lot of uncertainty is introduced because your business might get disrupted by platform changes happening in a few months.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Facebook APIs global design do not respect standards for a major part. The features are very diverse, which makes versioning hard to follow. The Developers Portal is rich and provides abundant tools, widgets and SDKs as well as code samples, but no interactive documentation. As a result, and although Facebook is a very rich and wide environment to develop mashups, its APIs are very hard to use and maintain.

                                The well-known history of Facebook tells how Mark Zuckerberg turned the “hot or not” hack that put him to trouble with the administration of Harvard into thefacebook.com, that was launched in February 2004 and restricted to Harvard students, and gradually opened to all Ivy League college, and then to most universities, then to high schools in September 2005, and finally opened to everyone on September 2006.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers). On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion. Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international adverts on the social networking site. In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. In September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Traffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. More people visited Facebook than Google for the week ending March 13, 2010.</br>
                                According to the Nielsen Media Research study, released in December 2011, Facebook is the second most accessed website in the US (behind Google).</br>
                                In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the site. The store will be available to iPhone, Android and mobile web users.</br>
                                Facebook held an initial public offering on May 17, 2012, negotiating a share price of $38 apiece. The company was valued at at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.

                            <p>
                                Facebook generally has a lower clickthrough rate (CTR) for advertisements than most major Web sites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole, although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while Google users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches), Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sarah Smith, who was Facebook's Online Sales Operations Manager, reports that successful advertising campaigns on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and that CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks. By comparison, the CTR for competing social network MySpace is about 0.1%, about 2.5 times better than Facebook's rate but still low compared to many other Web sites. The cause of Facebook's low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling ad blocking software and being better at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site being used more for the purpose of social communication as opposed to viewing content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49% for Wall posts.

                                The facebook data collects personal infos, personal interests, personal media content like status, photos or videos and friends network. That makes developers and 3rd-parties a highly valuable nework and dataset to access to build on top.

                            <p>
                                The Facebook Platform was launched in May 2007. It is a framework for software developers to create applications that in-teract with core Facebook features. A markup language called Facebook Markup Language was introduced simultaneously. Facebook Markup is used to customize the "look and feel" of applications that devel-opers create.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In November 2007, seven thousand appli-cations had been developed on the Face-book Platform, with another hundred cre-ated every day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In July 2008, by the second annual f8 de-velopers conference the number of appli-cations had grown to 33,000, and the num-ber of registered developers had exceeded 400,000.</br>
                                One year leater, Facebook integration was announced for the Xbox 360 and Nintendo DSi at E3.</br>
                                November 18, 2009, Sony announced an integration with Facebook to deliver the first phase of a variety of new features to further connect and enhance the online social experiences of PlayStation 3.</br>
                                In February 2010, Facebook announced the release of HipHop for PHP as an opensource project. HipHop describes a series of PHP execution engines and im-provements meant at first to save re-sources on Facebook servers. It appeared that  HipHop could substantially increase the speed of PHP applications in general. HipHop quickly became a big contribution to the Zend PHP ecosystem.

                                This number is to consider with care because of numerous registrations as developer to try Facebook features in priority</br>
                                Number of applications running : 550 000</br>

                                Facebook has been historically challenged by other social network-ing applications, some of which are still resisting the giant from Palo Al-to.</br>
                                Orkut is still a competitor to Face-book in selected markets, such as Brazil, India, Russia. But it is rapidly losing market shares.</br>
                                No competitor offers the kind of da-ta, programming environment and ecosystem Facebook’s API can of-fer. There is evidently no way to switch from Facebook if your app is Facebook API-based.

                                Facebook has a strong record of externalizing innovation through its APIs. About twenty startups building services on top of Facebook were acquired, then shut down, while their innovations were incorporated in Facebook and their team members joined Facebook. It can sound unhappy, but this is a fair strategy to manage innovation through a public API.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, Facebook also has a record of cutting off API access for infringing policies, particularly replicating core functionality, which Facebook used to justify revoking access to messaging apps, and Reciprocity, meaning that social services using Facebook API have to allow user to share experiences directly back on Facebook.

                            <p>
                                The APIs business model depends on the apps and the APIs used:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Apps using Facebook Developer Payment (for real money or Facebook Credits virtual currency) share revenue through a tax. Facebook will earn a 30% service fee, plus any applicable sales tax or VAT, in connection with each Facebook Payments trans-action on the platform</li>
                                <li>Apps using Ads API: to integrate ads within an app, developers need to go through ad providers allowed by Facebook (https://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/). The fee perceived by Facebook included in these providers fees is undisclosed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The APIs also drive product innovation at Facebook, as the past showed that many apps were bought out and then integrated in the service (list below).

                                The list makes it explicit what followed the merger or acquisition: continuity of the service in-sured in the best cases (Instagram), shut down and its core functionalities incorporated inside Facebook, or mere shutdown in the worst cases.

                            <h3>ToS Abstract</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Facebook policies are divided in twelve paragraphs.
                            </p>
                            <p>Paragraphs XI and XII state the license and definitions of the policies.</p>
                            <p>
                                Paragraphs I to VII (Features and Functionality, Data Collection and Use, Content, Application Integration Points, Enforcement, Changes, Branding and Promotion Poli-cy) are basically a translation of the principles of the Platform, which Facebook de-scribes as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Create a great user experience: Build social and engaging applications, Give users choice and control, Help users share expressive and relevant content</li>
                                    <li>Be trustworthy: Respect privacy, Don't mislead, confuse, defraud, or surprise us-ers, Don't spam - encourage authentic communications</li>
                                </ul>
                                Most notable point is Reciprocity. As stated by Facebook officials after shutting off MessageMe, the point of reciprocity is that Facebook awaits personalized or social experiences built using Facebook APIs to bring value to the Facebook experience; hence, experiences over third party apps have to be easily shared back on Facebook.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Paragraphs VIII to X describe Advertising Guidelines, Facebook Developer Payments Terms and Ads API. If you monetize your third party app via advertising or through the Facebook Developer Payment program, we advise strongly to read these paragraphs.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h2>API Design and Documentation</h2>
                            <p>
                                Facebook has an engineering culture driven by “Stay focused, keep shipping and break things”  and the partners of Facebook have to follow these changes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Part of this retooling means that there’s a maintenance tax on whatever app has been created on the platform, since you have to pull your prized engineers off their projects to do constant maintenance and reintegration into the new viral channels. That’s just to keep up. It also means that what works today may not work tomorrow. If you are making important decisions on staffing, business models, financing, then a lot of uncertainty is introduced because your business might get disrupted by platform changes happening in a few months.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Facebook APIs global design do not respect standards for a major part. The features are very diverse, which makes versioning hard to follow. The Developers Portal is rich and provides abundant tools, widgets and SDKs as well as code samples, but no interactive documentation. As a result, and although Facebook is a very rich and wide environment to develop mashups, its APIs are very hard to use and maintain.

                            <h3>Facebook APIs</h3>
                            <p>
                                <ul>

                                        <h4>Graph API</h4>
                                        The Graph API is a simple HTTP-based API that gives access to the Facebook social graph, uniformly representing objects in the graph and the connections between them. Most other APIs at Facebook are based on the Graph API.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>FQL</h4>
                                        Facebook Query Language, or FQL, enables you to use a SQL-style interface to query the data exposed by the Graph API. It provides for some advanced features not available in the Graph API such as using the results of one query in another.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Open Graph</h4>
                                        The Open Graph API allows apps to tell stories on Facebook through a structured, strongly typed API.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Dialogs</h4>
                                        Facebook offers a number of dialogs for Facebook Login, posting to a person's timeline or sending requests.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Chat</h4>
                                        You can integrate Facebook Chat into your Web-based, desktop, or mobile instant messaging products. Your instant messaging client connects to Facebook Chat via the Jabber/XMPP service.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Localization and translation</h4>
                                        Facebook supports localization of apps.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Ads API</h4>
                                        The Ads API allows you to build your own app as a customized alternative to the Facebook Ads Manager and Power Editor tools.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Public Feed API</h4>
                                        The Public Feed API lets you read the stream of public comments as they are posted to Facebook.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Keyword Insights API</h4>
                                        The Keyword Insights API exposes an analysis layer on top of all Facebook posts that enables you to query aggregate, anonymous insights about people mentioning a certain term.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Authentication Design</h3>
                            <p>
                                Facebook uses OAuth2.0 as authentication method for its APIs. Globally the documentation is highly detailled with lots of examples and SDK to make it easier for developer and 3rd parties.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Especially about OAuth : 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Facebook enables developers and 3rd-parties to have differents flows to implement their OAuth</li>
                                <li>OAuth 3 legged, OAuth 2 legged, device code, client credentials, enabling you to decide how do you want to manage the end-user account server side or client side, either the app account directly or connecting a 3rd device to Facebook (for example printing Facebook photos directly from an external printer)</li>
                                <li>Facebook OAuth has a revoke permissions enabling the end-user to be able to revoke the access to the application</li>
                                <li>Facebook OAuth has the cors call, enabling to connect on the client side.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Facebook and the RFC6749 standard</h5>
                            <p>
                                Not respecting the standards break the trust in the ecosystem, globally increase friction in overall API integration and make confusion in the head of developers and third parties about way to implement things where they will spend hours to understand and debug differences between each providers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the Facebook API part :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They call  "access_token" instead of "oauth_token"</li>
                                    <li>They use a comma "," as seprator in the  scopes nstead of a whitespace</li>
                                    <li>The use ‘ fb_exchange_token” instead of “refresh token”</li>
                                </ul>
                                Because of the popularity of Facebook Platform, some other API providers have considered Facebook  OAuth as the defacto Standard of API and OAuth design and have followed this non standard pattern.<
